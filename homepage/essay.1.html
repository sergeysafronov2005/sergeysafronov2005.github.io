            <h1>Manhattan Beach park</h1>
            <div class="essay container"> 
            <p>The main street that connects most of South Brooklyn is my street, Ocean Avenue. From all the way up North in Prospect Park to all the way down South in Manhattan Beach, this street connects thousands of people from all the different backgrounds you can imagine. I’ve been around most corners of this wide street, and I've seen the culture and people evolve and blossom as you go further North.
            </p>
            <p>On the South end, Emmons Avenue breaks up Ocean Avenue because of the Sheepshead Bay. Emmons is a street that is reminiscent of Manhattan, with its newly paved perfectly tiled walkway, chain restaurants with fancy seating, and lost tourists searching for Brighton and Coney Island. Emmons breaks Ocean with its Baku Palace and Soup & Burger, and that checkered supermarket most Sheepshead Bay residents went to, but don’t know the name of. It breaks it with its high school graduates walking around carefully not to crease their new thousand dollar shoes. It breaks it with its poser, fake fancy restaurants where people wear fake watches and imitation gold earrings to have a “fancy night out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Across the Bay, connected by a flimsy wooden bridge, lies the Manhattan Beach neighborhood. This neighborhood shares more with the borough that bears its name rather than Brooklyn or anything around it. Here exists a different Ocean Avenue, a more snooty and arrogant one. An Ocean Avenue that is silent instead of roaring with cars and middle schoolers yelling and arguing on their way home. An Ocean Avenue that is full of expensive, 18 year olds occasionally passing you in a new Mercedes their daddy bought them while giving you a dirty look, and old ladies with their trillion dollar custom-bred dogs. You feel like you walked into a gated, private community, separated by imaginary social lines instead of fences and security guards. All lawns are always perfectly trimmed, bushes shaped into spirals and spheres and rounded rectangular prisms. The gold paint on the elaborate fence designs never shows any signs of wear. The lion statues and Christian icons are always clean, void of any natural effects. You see sparrows and pigeons so rarely that it feels like they don’t exist here, like they know they don’t belong here either. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After five minutes of extremely uncomfortable walking through this neighborhood, you finally reach Manhattan Beach. Upon entrance, you are greeted by an ice cream truck that's always there regardless of season or time of day, a poorly leveled asphalt patch covering a brick-pattern floor, a soccer field with a bent and broken fence, and little kids screaming in the nearby park. In the summer, you hear music blasting, see people barbecuing, playing beach volleyball, sunbathing, swimming, playing cards, basketball on the courts, handball against a wall, soccer in the sand. You see people waiting for their overpriced six dollar ice creams and hot dogs, their three dollar cans of soda. It feels like home, like the Ocean Avenue North, something familiar, something that’s always there, something carefree and amazing. Something local, free of the big chains and the investors, free of the superficial and fake feel of Emmons Avenue, something free from the condescending atmosphere of the street that takes you there. Sometimes you see a person from the area, maybe a middle school friend, maybe that person you always saw at the store but never talked to, maybe a fellow B train rider. You see the community of all of South Brooklyn, of all of New York, a lively community of simple people. A community of a real New York.
